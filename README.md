This is a react app for slither link game with a few predefined puzzles.  
This is focussed mainly on the UI hence code to check for solution is a simple match check and not based on an algorithm.  
This app is hosted via [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Visit the app [here](https://ameygohil.github.io/slither-link/).  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
